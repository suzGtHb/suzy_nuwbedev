This project opens the first DOM page showing main 'Welcome' home page. Then there are 4 other Header and Footer links to other DOM pages I created - a 'Videos', 'Table', 'Contact', and 'Feedback', anchor link pages. This LiitWinProject.html project is done in 'OO' code using HTML5, CSS3, JSON files, jQuery and Ajax. I enjoyed creating it, it is very a cool project.\r\nI have the headers and footers on each DOM being loaded from the JSON files.   \r\n\r\n1. On the 'Videos' page try out all of the active buttons.  As the video is played or skipped the time left on the video displays beneath it. I added an input slider beneath the video; I programmed it to move along with the video as it plays or is skipped.   \r\n\r\n2. On the 'Table' DOM page contains a book table with the columns of book information also being loaded from a JSON files. At the top of the book table page there are sort selection buttons to sort on all table columns. I coded the program to sort in ascending and descending order.  If the same sort type button is selected it will first sort in ascending order, then if selected once more it will sort in descending order. The code triggers to toggle back and forth sorting if selecting the same sort column type. Once a different sort button type is selected it resets to sort in ascending order for each first time selected and continues the same behavior as noted prior.   \r\n\r\n3. The 'Feedback' Form page has all field entries required. Beneath the Comments entry box a count of the characters left displays as the user enters data. Error logic posts for any field data incorrectly. Once all fields are accepted by selecting the Submit button a 'Thank you for your comments' page is displayed.   \r\n\r\n4. I used event triggering to activate some of the features mentioned above each of the DOM's.   \r\n\r\n_**Now Why not select the link below to try it out in a browser:**_\r\n\r\n**<http://suzGtHb.github.io/suzy_nuwbedev/LiitWinProject.html>Web LIIT Project</>**\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
