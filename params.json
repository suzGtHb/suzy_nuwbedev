It opens the first DOM page showing main 'Welcome' home page. Then there are 4 other Header and Footer links to other DOM pages I created - a 'Videos' 'Table' 'Contact' and 'Feedback' anchor link pages. This LiitWinProject.html project is done in OO code using HTML5, CSS3, JSON files, jQuery and Ajax. I believe this is a very well done and cool project.\r\n\r\nI have the headers and footers on each DOM being loaded from the JSON files. Also on the 'Table' DOM page contains a book table with the columns of book information also being loaded from a JSON files. Also on the top of book table page there are sort selection buttons to sort on all columns on the table. They are coded to if first sorted in ascending order the code triggers to toggles in descending order if selecting the same sort column type. Once selected a different sort button type is resets to sort in ascending order for each first time selected. Other cute features are on the Video page and on the Form page where I keep a count of the time left on the video and the count of characters left on the form Comments box.\r\n\r\nYou can select the link below to try it out in a browser:\r\n\r\n<http://suzGtHb.github.io/suzy_nuwbedev/LiitWinProject.html>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
